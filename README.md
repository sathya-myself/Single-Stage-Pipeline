The architecture diagram illustrates the internal structure of the Single Stage Pipeline implemented in SystemVerilog.
This design represents a single pipeline stage that follows a ready/valid handshake protocol for flow control between upstream and downstream modules.
# The key architectural components include:
# Input Interface
in_valid → Indicates availability of valid input data
in_data → Data bus carrying payload
in_ready → Backpressure signal generated by pipeline stage
# Pipeline Registers
valid_reg → Tracks validity of stored data
data_reg → Holds input data when accepted
# Output Interface
out_valid → Asserted when pipeline contains valid data
out_data → Registered output data
out_ready → Indicates downstream readiness

# Single Stage Pipeline – SystemVerilog

A simple single-stage pipeline design implemented in SystemVerilog, verified using a ready/valid handshake protocol.

# Design Details
Parameterized data width
Pipeline register-based buffering
Backpressure handling via out_ready
Valid/Ready protocol

# Handshake Logic
in_ready = (~valid_reg) || out_ready
out_valid = valid_reg
out_data  = data_reg

# Verification
Functional simulation performed using:
Xilinx Vivado (RTL simulation)
XSIM

# Reset Behavior:
Observation:
When rst_n = 0
valid_reg → 0
out_valid → 0
out_data → 0
# Data Acceptance: 
in_valid = 1  
in_ready = 1  ---> The Waveform shows an data captured into an data_reg
# Output Transfer:
out_valid = 1  
out_ready = 1 --> data accepted by downstram logic 
# Inputs & Outputs:
in_valid = 1  
out_ready = 1  
valid_reg = 1 ---> Output is consumed, New input data captured in same cycle so valid_reg remains 1
# Stall Condition: 
valid_reg = 1  
out_ready = 0 --> Backpressure handled correctly
                  No data overwrite
                  Registers retain state

# Ready Signal Logic Validation:
Waveform validates derived logic:
in_ready = (~valid_reg) || out_ready
