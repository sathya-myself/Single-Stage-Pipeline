# Single-Stage-Pipeline
Single-Stage Pipeline (Non-Pipelined Processor)  A Single-Stage Pipeline is a processor architecture in which each instruction completes all phases of execution within a single clock cycle. The instruction goes through fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back sequentially, without any overlap with other instructions.
